While fighting, anything could happen such as Random Drops(Gold, Statpoints, Bag drops, Demon spawns, and so much more) or in the unlikley event that the monster you are fighting is stronger than you; you will die!!! In which case you must pay to revive(unless under level 50) at the cost of your total Constitution skill.<br /><br />To begin fighting click the \"Fight\" button in the center of the page!<br /><img border=\"1\" src=\"tfiTutorial/images/fighting1.jpg\"><br /><br />Once you have clicked \"Fight\", you may have noticed that there is a small delay.

A repetitive round will look something like this:<br /><img border=\"1\" src=\"tfiTutorial/images/fighting3.jpg\"><br /> This will only happen if you did not hit the enemy for enough damage to knock out it\'s total Health points or if you failed to hit the enemy and the enemy fails to kill you. If the enemy does kill you, as I described above, you will have to revive your character to resume fighting again.<br /><br /><h2>How to get more health</h2><br/>Health is determined by your Endurance skill. With a greater amount of Health the longer a difficult battle will last for.
