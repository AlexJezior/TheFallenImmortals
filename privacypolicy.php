We urge parents and legal guardians to instruct their children to never give out their personal information online without permission. We also recognize a special need to protect personal information obtained from children. In compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of 13 (“kids”): <br /><br />ROI does require all users to provide us with his/her e-mail address in order to set up a free account and register a character in our game. If we are aware that the user is under the age of 13, at this time we require for the parents to set up the account for their kids. The setting up of the account by the parents is considering an actual verifiable consent by the parent for the kid to use this website as required by COPPA. <br /><br />ROI recognizes that young children may inadvertently give out personal information in addition to their e-mail address when contacting us with any questions, problems, or concerns they have encountered while playing the game. We do not collect or use any such additional personal information acquired in this manner unless it is necessary for us to respond to the problem or question or concern. We do not divulge any such information to any third parties unless we are required to do so by law, court order or subpoena. <br /><br />ROI game is unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. We use the e-mails to notify our users of all the upcoming upgrades, events, changes, improvements, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that ROI has designed and made available exclusively to our users. Please note, that the products and services are from ROI only and will not come from any advertisers or third parties. <br /><br />If a kid desires to upgrade his/her account, a parent or legal guardian will be required to divulge additional reasonably necessary information as described above under personally identifiable information and Terms and Conditions. <br /><br />ROI does not sell or knowingly divulge your kid's information to advertisers or any other third parties, unless we are required to share your kid's information with a third party in order to comply with law, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our website or game rules; to protect the safety and security of our users and our website.Also, please note that ROI does not condition a kid's participation in an online activity on the kid providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the activity. <br /><br />Once again, we would like to assure you that we do not keep any information other than what is listed above. However, parents are welcome to contact us about any personally identifiable information about their child by emailing alex.jezior@gmail.com. Parents can then request to purge either all or specific portions of that information by e-mailing alex.jezior@gmail.com.<br /><br />PASSWORD SAFETY<br />It is the responsibility of the player to keep their password safe. There are several steps you can take to ensure the safety of your password. Scan your computer regularly with an updated virus scanner. Use a password that cannot be easily guessed. Create an account ‘question and answer’ which you cannot easily forget to recover your password if you forget it. Forgeting of your password and your ‘question and answer’ may led indirectly to a closure of your account.<br /><br />CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br />You may request that your information be changed, corrected or deleted from our databases by writing ROI at Contact us form, which you can find in the header of the game, or posting your mail directly on alex.jezior@gmail.com e-mail address. Any personally identifiable information collected by a content delivery provider may also be governed by that content delivery provider's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.<br /><br />E-MAIL NOTIFICATION<br />By registering on the Site you authorize ROI to send you email from time to time. Generally, we send email to you about our updates, services, content and special offers. You agree that as a subscriber to the website, ROI may send you such email to the address you provide.
