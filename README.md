For now...... PHP 5.6 is slow, and I do not wish to continue supporting for it.

##History
In December 2009, I had an idea to develop a text-based MMORPG game for the browser, so that any user, coming from any 
computer environment would have an opportunity to connect. February 2010 was the first time the project came to life on 
the internet, and lasted until the summer of 2014. For years, I have held onto this project with the hope, that one day 
soon, I would redevelop it with better, and up to date, coding conventions. As my development ideas have grown, so has 
my want to develop a variety of practical applications for the internet. With that being said, I am letting my stepping 
stone grow some wings and tossing it out to the open world!
######
Feel free to use, and develop upon this project per the License attached to this repository. Keeping in mind, this 
project uses dated and deprecated PHP and MySQL coding techniques that were acceptable in 2009, but are no longer 
supported by the newer programming technology updates. **PHP 5.6** is the last known version to support this project; 
for a fact, **this will not work on PHP 7.**

##Installation
So, you want to install this beast? In this section, I will help with the general setup of this project on your server. 
It's very straight forward, as long as you understand your way around the server. There's a lot of information on the 
internet, so it should not be a problem. ;)
######
You'll want to zip this project and extract it to your sites root path.
######
After the project files are on your server, let's setup the the database. Grab the .sql file from the "installation" 
folder and import the SQL file, via phpMyAdmin panel, to the database you created for this project.
######
With the database tables populated to your table, we will want to setup the association to your database in the code. 
Open db.php, index.php, indexdb.php, and add your database credentials. Once you have done that, you should be ready to 
register your first character! 
######
**REMEMBER TO DELETE THE INSTALLATION FOLDER AFTER INSTALLING THIS PROJECT ON YOUR SERVER. IT'S ONLY REQUIRED FOR 
INSTALLING THE SITE, NOTHING MORE. DO I NEED TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF REMOVING THE SITE'S .ZIP FOLDER THAT YOU 
BROUGHT IT IN WITH?**

##About the Developer
My name is Alexander Jezior, and I enjoy developing in PHP! Over the years, I have evolved my code base into something 
that this project does not accurately depict. This project merely shows an example of where I started, and gives a sense 
of my experience as a developer. Now-a-days, you can find me spending my time trying to build my own frame work, or CMS,
 and at times, dabbling with other developers ideas, such as, Laravel, or OctoberCMS. Feel free to connect with me, 
 I'm always happy to talk about programming!
